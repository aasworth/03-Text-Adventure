# 03-Text-Adventure
Repository to work on creating my first text adventure game in python

In This folder I am creating a game similar to Zork, but it is set up in a post - futuristic war New York City.
You will be able to adventure around this digital world and explore everything it has to show! Currently, it will
not have a functioning inventory system as of this stage of development, but I am hoping in future updates/patches
that it will include everything needed to be a fully functional game.
